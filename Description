This project develops a robust and scalable hand gesture recognition system by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Traditional methods often struggle with dynamic real-world conditions and require extensive labeled datasets. By leveraging GANs to generate diverse synthetic training data, the system minimizes dependency on large labeled datasets while enhancing adaptability to varying lighting, backgrounds, and motion dynamics. The hybrid GAN-CNN approach ensures high recognition accuracy, reduced computational effort, and real-time applicability, paving the way for more intuitive and responsive humanâ€“machine interactions.
