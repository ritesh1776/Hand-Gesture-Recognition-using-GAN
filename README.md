# ðŸ“Œ Hand Gesture Recognition using GANs and CNNs

## ðŸ“– Overview  
This project presents a hybrid deep learning approach for hand gesture recognition by integrating **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. Traditional models struggle with limited data and performance under varying conditions. To overcome these issues, GANs are employed to generate synthetic data, enhancing model generalization and accuracy.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Improve gesture classification accuracy through data augmentation using GANs.  
- Design a robust CNN architecture with advanced feature extraction capabilities.  
- Reduce reliance on large labeled datasets while ensuring adaptability in real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ§  Approach  
1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: GANs are used to generate diverse hand gesture images, enriching the training dataset.  
2. **CNN Training**: The augmented dataset is used to train a CNN for accurate gesture classification.  
3. **Model Optimization**: A custom CNN architecture combining parallel and sequential layers is implemented for better performance.  
4. **Evaluation**: Compared the performance of three models:
   - Baseline CNN  
   - CNN with GAN-augmented data  
   - Modified CNN (parallel + sequential architecture)
